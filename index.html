          <p>I have and always will be a petrol head which is why I started my career as a Motor Vehicle Mechanic before moving onto Mechanical Engineering where most of my career has been focused. I have also done training in Electronic Engineering to make myself Multiskilled. I have found that the methodical approach used in my field of expertise has helped me to adapt to Web Development extremly well. </p>
